A first my flutter project.
This App can chat to friend, send photos, create new Account...

# Main Features
- Send message to friends
- Sharing of photos
- Find your friend
- Change dark/light theme
- Update avatar

# Project Structure
This is a Flutter mobile app targeting Android.
The code for the Flutter app is contained in the folder `lib` and the different native apps are in `android`.
Folder `repo` hosts a series of Firebase config 

# Prerequisites & Getting Started
## Client 
To build and run the mobile apps you’ll need to install Flutter and its dependencies. To verify your installation run in the project’s root directory:
``` 
$ flutter doctor
```
## Backend (Firebase)

### B1. Setup sign-in
An initial sign-in method needs to be configured.
- Select your project in [console.firebase.google.com](console.firebase.google.com).
- Navigate to `Authentication`
- Select `Sign-in methods` and activate `Email / Password`.

### B2. Configure firebase app
Follow the instructions in [Link](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup).

### B3. Create and setup database
In the firebase console select `Firestore Database` under `Build` and create a Cloud Firestore Database. Setup database in `test mode` if you don't want to care about access permissions now.

#### Create users collection
- Select the database you’ve just created.
- Create `collection` and name it `users`.

# Architecture
## MVVM (Model–view–viewmodel)
### Model
This layer can contain business logic, code validation, etc. This layer interacts with ViewModel for local data or for real-time. Data are given in response to ViewModel.
My Models in the folder `lib/store/models`
### ViewModel
ViewModel is the mediator between View and Model, which accept all the user events and request that to Model for data. Once the Model has data then it returns to ViewModel and then ViewModel notify that data to View.
ViewModel in the folder `lib/store/view_model`
My ViewModel contain `dispatch` to receive request from user in `View` to `Middleware`
### View
The view is where the user is interacting with Widgets that are shown on the screen. These user events request some actions which navigate to ViewModel, and the rest of ViewModel does the job. Once ViewModel has the required data then it updates View.

## Redux
Redux is a unidirectional data flow architecture that makes it easy to develop, maintain and test applications.
### Redux Elements:

Redux consists of 3 main parts:
#### View:
View is the UI for users to interact, send action
#### Action:
Actions are generated by application events and carry the information which will be consumed by the reducers.
My Actions in `lib/store/actions`
Main actions: auth, list friend, send message, register, change page, change theme, update info,...
#### Reducer:
Reducers are functions that take the `current state` and an `action` as arguments, and return a `new state` result. In other words, (state, action) => newState.
#### Middleware:
If we’d like to create separate layers for data handling we should use middleware. This way we are able to intercept actions and transform the information from their payload before it reaches the reducers.
